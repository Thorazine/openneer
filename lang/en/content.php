I have a predilection for devising and building clear UIs and building the desired design pixel-perfect. I find working in a team very pleasant. I am often labeled as lead, although that is certainly not a requirement. My character is highly desirable on the work floor: hard-working, persevering, serious, funny, always cheerful, positive, realistic, stimulating and goals-oriented. If you want to see my code, I recommend looking at Github.',
